## Description

Being a new student of coding engineering, there's a lot of information being thrown at you at once and it's hard to keep track of it, especially when you're not exactly sure what you should be keeping track of. 

This project was formulated to and built to help sort out the different areas of coding that a student is going to incounter. This app is easy on the eyes and it siomplifies the 3 main languages of coding by setting in individual boxes to naviagate through separately. 

This application helps prevents disorganization and clutter so an idividual doesn't group all aspects of coding into one; but rather are able seperate different lessons.

This journey thus far has taught me several factors about coding, especially in javascript when it comes to debugging. Above all precision is important in coding, from where you place a "." to if you've closed a bracket or not, these minor human mistakes can cause a code to be disfunctional. Despite this being fustratiing, when I would get codes correct or debugged, I felt victorious.
